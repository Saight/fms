The category of flexible flow shop scheduling problems has a long history in the literature and has been addressed in a great amount of papers. Arthanari and Ramamurthy \cite{arth1971} are credited to be among the first to have brought up the problem. Since then a lot of different angles of the initial problem have been looked at, an article published by Wang \cite{wang2005} in 2005 provides a general overview of different approaches and special cases. More recently Jungwattanakit et al \cite{jung2009} published a comparison of scheduling algorithms for flexible flow shop problems specifically looking at problems with unrelated parallel machines, setup times and dual criteria.

The biggest subcategory of flexible flow shop problems that the problem in this paper falls into is the category of cyclic flexible flow shop.
